       <div class="center-column"><p>My name is Tahaylia. I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Foreign Languages, Spanish and German, respectively and a background in Software Engineering (Web design, Front-End &amp; Back-End). I also have a <strong>strong</strong> interest in UI/UX Design. </p>
      <p>I first got bitten by the 'coding bug' when I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago as a Modern Languages major and was looking to quench my ‘creative thirst’ while job hunting. I chose to occupy my time with photo editing, UI and logo design via Adobe Photoshop and Figma, as well as video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro.<br/><br/> These creative undertakings quickly reminded me of how much I enjoyed personalizing a blog I once had with snippets of html code. I then decided to fully immerse myself into the wonderful world of scripting/programming languages via self-study, and, needless to say—I was hooked!<br/><br/>The joy I feel from designing and developing web pages has influenced my decision to switch my career path to the Tech industry.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="right-column">
       <p>This decision led me to Arizona State University (ASU). However, being an individual with an avid thirst for knowledge in my prospective career, I recognized that the degree program I was pursuing at ASU (Full-Stack Web Development) did not bridge the 'gap' between school learning materials and real world job training skills. I've therefore, sought after enrolling in Per Scholas, a Software Engineering Program to refine my skills.</p>
      
      <p>During my time at Per Scholas, something amazing happened! I've discovered that my creative hobbies (those mentioned previously) have only grown stronger with each project I design and develop. I, therefore, have an overwhelming desire to embark on a journey where I am able to gain in-depth knowledge of UI/UX design to contribute greatly to the field of technology.
